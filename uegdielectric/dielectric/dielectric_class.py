        Electron-ion collision frequency, which depends on the material we

        """
        The dielectric function of the electron gas as a function of the wave
        number (q) and frequency (omega) modes excited by a perturbation
        If the electron-ion collision frequency (collfreq) is not supplied, this
        returns the random phase approximation (RPA) dielectric function. If a
        collision frequency is used, this returns the Mermin dielectric
        function.

        The uniform electron gas is a theoretical creation that does not exist
        in nature, although there are some metals (like aluminum, for example)
        whose electrons almost behave like an free/ideal electron gas. The goal
        of including a collision frequency parameter is to improve the electron
        gas description to better predict the behavior of true materials that
        have ions present. As such, the collision frequency is a material-
        dependent quantity. It can also be frequency dependent (that
        is, dependent on omega).

        All parameters are in atomic units (a.u.).

        Parameters:
        ___________
        q: array_like of real values
            The spatial frequency of the perturbation acting on the electron
            gas. Units are a.u. or units of 1/a0, where
            a0 = Bohr radius = 0.529 Angstrom.
        omega: array_like of real values
            Temporal frequency of the perturbation acting on the electron
            gas. Units are a.u. or units of Ha, where
            Ha = Hartree energy = 27.2114 eV.

        Returns:
        ________
        ret: ndarray of complex values
            If q and omega are both 1D arrays, shape will be
            (size(q), size(omega)). Otherwise, if only one of these arguments is
            a 1D array of size n and the other is a scalar, the shape is
            (size(n),). If both arguments are scalars, the result is a complex
            scalar as well.

    Notes:
    ______
     In the collective limit (for example, for small wavenumbers), it can be helpful to
     dampen the RPA response with a small collision frequency to avoid numerical
     issues. How small is up to you (the larger the value, the less RPA-like the
     calculation), but a good first attempt is
     0.03675 ~ 1/27.2114 = 1/Ha, where Ha = Hartree energy = 27.2114 eV. The following
     example shows how this can be done.
